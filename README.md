### Security & Safety
- **Sandboxed Operations**: File operations run in Electron main process
- **User Confirmation**: All destructive actions require confirmation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **Access Control**: Limited file system access to user directories

## 💻 Prerequisites

- **Node.js 16+** (LTS recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Windows 10/11** (with PowerShell)
- **OpenAI API key** (optional, for enhanced AI features)
- **Microphone access** (optional, for voice commands)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone or download the project
# Navigate to the project directory
cd Smart File-Explorer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the application
npm start
```

### Optional: AI Features Setup
For enhanced AI capabilities, create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

> **Note**: The application works without an API key using local AI processing, but advanced features require OpenAI integration.
