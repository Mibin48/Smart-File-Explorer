# Smart AI File Explorer - Development Plan

## Project Overview
Modern AI assistant for Windows File Explorer using React + TypeScript + Electron with AI integration.

## Core Features to Implement
- [x] Voice and text-based interaction (CommandInput component with voice support)
- [x] Smart file search using natural language queries (AI command processing)
- [x] Batch file operations (move, copy, delete, rename) (IPC handlers in main.js)
- [ ] File summarization and preview
- [ ] Auto-sorting and folder cleanup suggestions
- [ ] Custom command definitions

## Project Structure Setup
- [x] Create TODO.md file
- [x] Update package.json with React, TypeScript dependencies
- [x] Create tsconfig.json
- [x] Create src folder structure (components, hooks, commands)
- [x] Update main.js for React support
- [x] Update preload.js for React IPC
- [x] Create React entry point (src/index.tsx)

## Sample UI Components
- [x] FileTree component (hierarchical file navigation)
- [x] CommandInput component (voice + text input)
- [x] ActionPreview component (shows AI interpretation)
- [x] FileList component (file display with selection)
- [x] App component (main layout)

## AI Integration
- [x] OpenAI API integration for natural language processing
- [x] Prompt parsing logic (AICommandProcessor class)
- [x] Safe file operation execution (confirmation dialogs)
- [x] Example natural language search implementation

## Architecture & Security
- [x] Windows file system access best practices (async fs, error handling)
- [x] Security recommendations for file operations (confirmation dialogs)
- [x] Fluent/Mica UI style implementation (Tailwind with modern design)
- [x] Error handling and user confirmation flows

## Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Test natural language search example
- [ ] Create README with setup instructions
- [ ] Document architecture decisions
- [ ] Add usage examples
